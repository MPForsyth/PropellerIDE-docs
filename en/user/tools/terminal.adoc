# Terminal

PropellerIDE has a built-in serial terminal you can use to debug your Propeller programs.

There are no restrictions on the number of terminals that can be open at a time, even on the same device, and software can be downloaded to attached devices without disconnecting terminals first.

## Input

There are two ways to input text

- Through the console itself
- Through the _input line_ at the bottom of the window

### Console

Using the console is recommended when the target device supports a more advanced command-line interface, as it will allow you to take advantage of things like readline capabilities, cursor positioning, etc.

Pressing the `Enter` or `Return` key sends a single newline (ASCII `10`) to the device.

### Input Line

For simpler interfaces, the input line is a better choice.

Pressing the `Enter` or `Return` sends the text without newline. Pressing the _Send_ button sends the text plus a single newline.
