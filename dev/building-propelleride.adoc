= Building PropellerIDE

The following dependencies are needed to build PropellerIDE:

*   Qt5.3 or later

PropellerIDE has been built on the following platforms:

-   Windows (Vista, 7, 8)
-   Mac OS X (10.6 onward)
-   Ubuntu (12.04 onward)
-   Raspbian OS
-   pcDuino

PropellerIDE has been built with the following compiler toolchains:

-   GCC
-   MinGW-x64
-   Clang
-   MSVC

== Getting the source

Check out the project and its dependencies.

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/parallaxinc/PropellerIDE.git

== Building the executable

=== Using `qmake`

PropellerIDE can be built from the command-line using `qmake` to generate 
makefiles.

    cd PropellerIDE
    qmake

If you have made changes to the `.pro` files, remember to use `-r` to 
update all makefiles, not just the current one.

    qmake -r

Use Make to build the project. On most Linuxes, GNU Make is ubiquitous. 
PropellerIDE supports parallel builds, so make sure to specify the number of 
jobs with `-j`.

    make -j16

The makefiles support standard makefile targets: `make clean` removes object 
files, `make distclean` removes object files and makefiles.

==== Windows

You will need to download Qt5 from the Qt website. You will also need Inno 
Setup to build the Windows installer.

-   http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

Qt is distributed with either a MinGW or MSVC toolchain on Windows. Be sure to 
add the paths to the toolchain and Inno Setup to the system environment.

    C:\Qt\Tools\mingw482_32\bin;C:\Qt\5.3\mingw482_32\bin;C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 5

The MinGW toolchain is painfully slow, but you can build with `mingw32-make`, 
which supposedly supports parallel builds but is slow as a dog anyway so it 
makes little difference.

    mingw32-make

If you've decided to install Visual Studio, you'll have an instance 
of `nmake`. You can enable parallel builds by setting the CL environment 
variable, which will speed things up considerably. 

    set CL=/MP

Then start the build.

    nmake

=== Using QtCreator

PropellerIDE may also be built with QtCreator, but it should be noted that 
QtCreator and `qmake` builds seem to be incompatible with each other, 
so `make distclean` should be called before switching between them.

=== Using CMake

Instructions on CMake builds are not yet available.

== Packaging For release

PropellerIDE is distributed in standalone packages using `packthing`, an open 
source packaging tool available on
link:https://github.com/lamestation/packthing[GitHub] or downloadable via the 
Python Package Index.

Via GitHub:

    git clone https://github.com/lamestation/packthing
    cd packthing
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python setup.py install

Via PyPI:

    pip install packthing
